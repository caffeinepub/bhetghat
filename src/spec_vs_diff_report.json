REQ-39 is not evidenced in the provided diff summary (no actor creation/useActor changes shown), so the createActor warning fix appears missing from this change set.",

      "requirement": "Remove the production console warning by ensuring the frontend actor creation path passes only one of `agent` or `agentOptions` to `createActor` (including authenticated identity case in `frontend/src/hooks/useActor.ts`).",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows modifications only to `frontend/src/components/AppLayout.tsx` and metadata/summary files; there is no evidence of changes to the actor creation path or `frontend/src/hooks/useActor.ts` to prevent passing both `agent` and `agentOptions`.",
