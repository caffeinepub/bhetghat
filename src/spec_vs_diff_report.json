  "summary": "REQ-16 is partially addressed by updating the service worker to avoid precaching /src paths and to tolerate missing assets with an offline fallback. However, REQ-15 static icon file presence cannot be confirmed from the diff (no icon assets added), and REQ-14 backend build/deploy root-cause validation/fixes are not evidenced (no backend or deployment config changes shown). Additionally, new user-facing Nepali text was introduced despite the request to use English for user-facing additions/changes.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-14",
      "requirement": "Identify and fix the root cause of the deployment/build failure (“System configuration error”) by validating build inputs (frontend static asset references + backend canister compilation) and making necessary adjustments so build+deploy succeeds and backend compiles.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows changes limited to frontend offline/service-worker assets and a project state description; there is no evidence of backend compilation fixes, canister configuration/build pipeline changes, or a demonstrated root-cause fix for the deployment error.",
      "evidence": [
        "file-diff shows no backend/* changes; only frontend/public/offline.html, frontend/public/sw.js, project_state.json, frontend-file-summaries.txt"

      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Ensure all files referenced by PWA configuration are present under frontend/public, specifically the listed generated icons referenced by manifest/index.html, and ensure manifest is fetchable and valid JSON.",
      "reason": "The service worker references the required icon paths, but the diff does not show the actual icon files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated (or any manifest/index.html updates confirming references). Therefore, presence/location of those assets and manifest correctness cannot be verified from the provided diff summary.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/public/sw.js (CORE_ASSETS includes /assets/generated/*.png)",
        "No added/modified files shown for frontend/public/manifest.webmanifest or frontend/index.html contents; no added icon files under frontend/public/assets/generated/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "requirement": "Use English for any user-facing text added or changed as part of this fix request.",
      "reason": "New offline user-facing content includes Nepali text (and mixed-language button label), which violates the stated constraint.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/public/offline.html (contains Nepali paragraphs and “Retry / पुन: प्रयास गर्नुहोस्”)",

      "description": "Bilingual (English+Nepali) offline fallback page and mixed-language UI copy (including Nepali text and emoji/animation styling).",
      "reason": "REQ-16 asks for offline fallback behavior, but does not request adding Nepali/localized copy or bilingual/mixed-language messaging; additionally it conflicts with the constraint to add/change user-facing text in English only for this fix.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/public/offline.html",
