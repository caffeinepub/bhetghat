  "summary": "Building “Bhetghat”, a free bilingual (English+Nepali) Nepali dating web app similar to Tinder, with swipe matching, detailed profiles, chat after matching, advertisement space, and optimized as an installable PWA (Add to Home Screen) since App Store/Play Store distribution and Nepali wallet payments aren’t supported.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Payments disabled: no eSewa/Khalti/Nepali banking wallets; build as free app without requiring credit card/Stripe.",
    "Target is a mobile-friendly web app (not native Android/iOS). Provide installable experience via PWA/Add to Home Screen (not App Store/Play Store).",
    "Platform constraint: cannot use Supabase/Node-style server routes; backend must run on Internet Computer (Motoko), so Khalti/eSewa integrations are not supported here.",
    "Blank white screen root cause identified: production is attempting to load frontend entry at /src/main.tsx (dev-only path) instead of the built asset bundle under /assets; app entry point/index.html needs correction for production builds.",
    "Startup/blank-page mitigation decision: temporarily disable/unregister the PWA service worker to bypass potentially stale cached index.html/assets until the production entry-point issue is fully resolved.",
    "Console shows manifest icon load/validity problem: /assets/generated/pwa-icon.dim_192x192.png is failing to download or is not a valid image; PWA icon assets under frontend/public/assets/generated need to be valid PNGs and correctly served in production.",
    "Browser console warning: <meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\"> is deprecated; add/ensure <meta name=\"mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\"> for modern compatibility (non-blocking).",
    "Runtime crash identified: `useI18n must be used within I18nProvider` coming from AppLayout; app root must wrap AppLayout in I18nProvider (and ensure i18n initialization occurs before any component calls useI18n).",
    "Production console error observed: `[Boot Watchdog] App failed to mount within 10 seconds`, indicating the React app bundle is still not mounting in production (blank screen persists; error appears after a few seconds).",

    "Root cause identified for blank page: production is trying to load /src/main.tsx (not present in production), preventing React from mounting; fix requires updating the app entry point/index.html to reference built assets.",
    "Likely contributor to persistent blank page: service worker caching/serving stale index.html or asset paths; plan is to temporarily disable the service worker to force fresh loads.",
    "Production console reports manifest icon error: https://bhetghat-fus.caffeine.xyz/assets/generated/pwa-icon.dim_192x192.png is not a valid image or failed to download (may affect PWA installability and could contribute to startup issues).",
