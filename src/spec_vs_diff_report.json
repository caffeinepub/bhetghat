  "summary": "Implemented a session-gated mobile-number entry screen, added localStorage-based pending phone number persistence with auto-save to caller profile when available, and applied a global orange/pink gradient background. Some requirement details are either not fully met or cannot be verified from the provided diff summary (notably the menu overlay fix and exact button labeling/phone overwrite behavior).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "When the user enters a mobile number on the first screen, persist it by saving it into the caller’s profile phone number field (DatingProfile.phoneNumber).",
      "reason": "The pending-phone saver only writes the pending number if the fetched profile exists and does not already have a phone number. If a user enters a number and the profile already has phoneNumber set, the new entry will not be applied, which may violate the expectation that Continue saves the entered number (and only Skip avoids saving/overwriting).",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/hooks/usePendingPhoneNumber.ts (only saves when `pendingPhone && !profile.phoneNumber`)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Remove/fix the persistent web-page overlay so that no unintended transparent/blur overlay blocks interaction after the menu is closed; ensure overlay only exists while menu is open and is fully removed/disabled when closed.",
      "reason": "The diff does not show any explicit change that removes/disables a lingering overlay/backdrop element after closing the menu (e.g., removal of a custom overlay element, CSS pointer-events changes, or explicit unmounting logic). While AppLayout uses a Sheet component with controlled open state, the summary alone does not prove that a prior persistent overlay bug is fixed.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/AppLayout.tsx (Sheet open state added/used, but no explicit overlay/backdrop cleanup shown)"
